A video is usually stored as a sequence of independent frames. That format is
convenient for playback, but it says nothing about *how* the visual content
changes over time.

**MBB-GS represents a video as a fixed population of 2D Gaussians whose
attributes are continuous functions of time.** The model stores polynomial
coefficients, not frames, so the video becomes a signal that can be evaluated at
any instant — including instants that were never recorded. As a complementary
extension, the same philosophy is applied to audio with Gabor atoms.

Two properties follow directly from this design. **Temporal interpolation is
free**: evaluating the trained model between two original frames needs no second
network, no optical flow and no extra training. And **the model can be pruned
and quantised after training**, because each Gaussian owns an explicit,
inspectable set of coefficients.

## Method

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/pipeline.png" width="95%" alt="Training pipeline: video, model, render, frame, loss, with backpropagation returning to the model">
</div>

Training is a single differentiable loop. A frame is rendered from the model,
compared against the original, and the gradient flows back through the
rasteriser into the polynomial coefficients. There is no network anywhere in
that loop — the coefficients *are* the model.

A single set of $N$ Gaussians is kept for the entire clip. Nothing is created or
destroyed between frames. Each attribute $p$ of each Gaussian $i$ — position,
opacity, colour, scale, rotation and depth — is a Chebyshev polynomial in
normalised time $\tau(t) \in [-1, 1]$:

$$p_i(t) = a_{i,0}^{(p)} + \sum_{k=1}^{K_p} a_{i,k}^{(p)} \, T_k(\tau(t))$$

To render frame $t$ the polynomials are evaluated and the resulting Gaussians
are fed to a differentiable CUDA rasteriser:

$$t \longrightarrow \tau(t) \longrightarrow G(t) \longrightarrow \hat{I}(t)$$

Each attribute gets its own degree $K_p$, because they do not need the same
temporal capacity: position and opacity change a lot, depth and rotation usually
do not. A production configuration uses degrees 100 / 80 / 30 / 12 / 6 / 4 for
`mu` / `opacity` / `color` / `scale` / `theta` / `depth`.

Chebyshev is the main basis: it is bounded on $[-1, 1]$ and well conditioned at
high degree, which matters at those degrees. A monomial basis is kept only for
the ablation that motivates the choice, and to load older checkpoints.

Because every primitive owns an explicit trajectory $\mu_i(t)$, the model can
be inspected directly: which Gaussians move, how far, and when. The scripts in
`scripts/visualization/` draw exactly that.

For the details, see
[Model and Temporal Representation](wiki/Model-and-Temporal-Representation.md)
and [CUDA Rasterizer](wiki/CUDA-Rasterizer.md).

## Results

Every number below is read from a record committed under `results/`, or noted as
living on the Drive. Full tables and settings: [Results](wiki/Results.md).

**Loss ablation** — 600 frames, 720p, 100k Gaussians, 800 epochs. Weighting the
error towards moving regions wins on every metric:

| Loss | PSNR ↑ | PSNR min ↑ | SSIM ↑ | LPIPS ↓ | Temporal PSNR ↑ |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Baseline (L1 + DSSIM) | 31.83 | 28.10 | 0.962 | 0.0594 | 35.17 |
| Edge | 31.88 | 28.05 | 0.963 | 0.0574 | 35.23 |
| Temporal | 31.93 | 28.32 | 0.963 | 0.0588 | 35.32 |
| **Motion** | **33.24** | **30.32** | **0.965** | **0.0483** | **36.88** |

**Temporal basis** — a deliberately small setting (8k Gaussians, 120 frames at
160×160, 360 epochs, degree 30 for `mu`) that isolates the effect of the basis:

| Basis | PSNR ↑ | PSNR min ↑ | SSIM ↑ | Temporal PSNR ↑ |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Monomial | 23.16 | 20.19 | 0.750 | 30.61 |
| **Chebyshev** | **29.95** | **27.70** | **0.926** | **34.04** |

**Frame aggregation** — the exponent $q$ that combines per-frame errors. Quality
falls monotonically, so the uniform average is the right choice:

| $q$ | PSNR ↑ | PSNR min ↑ | SSIM ↑ | LPIPS ↓ |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| **1** | **33.24** | **30.02** | **0.964** | **0.048** |
| 2 | 29.77 | 27.43 | 0.942 | 0.099 |
| 4 | 21.19 | 16.84 | 0.859 | 0.336 |
| 8 | 14.70 | 13.37 | 0.517 | 0.821 |

**Capacity** — the same frame reconstructed with a growing population. At low
counts the Gaussians cannot cover the frame and the render breaks into speckle;
the coverage closes progressively, and at 150k the reconstruction is clean:

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/reconstruccion_n_gaussianas.png" width="95%" alt="Six reconstructions of the same frame at 5k, 10k, 20k, 40k, 60k and 150k Gaussians, progressively sharper">
</div>

**Model reduction** — from 150k Gaussians on 750 frames at 720p, adaptive
pruning to 120k Gaussians followed by UINT16 quantisation takes the model from
about 236 MB to 85 MB, at roughly 63 dB PSNR against the full reconstruction: a
2.8× reduction at a difference that is effectively invisible.

**Audio** — 9 s of stereo at 44.1 kHz with 160k Gabor atoms in Mid-Side reaches
27.78 dB SNR and 27.77 dB SI-SDR.

**The recipe.** The final video configuration is the `motion` loss with
`lambda_motion: 2.0`, `lambda_dssim: 0.25` and `exponente_frame: 1`.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.10
- NVIDIA GPU for CUDA training
- CUDA Toolkit compatible with the installed PyTorch build
- C++ compiler compatible with PyTorch
- FFmpeg and FFprobe on `PATH`
- Conda
- 7-Zip is optional and is only used for the final lossless package archive

The current default setup targets PyTorch with CUDA 12.6.

### Windows

The recommended installation path is the automated PowerShell installer:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/JLeandroJM/MBB-GS-Moving-Gaussians.git
cd MBB-GS-Moving-Gaussians
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\setup.ps1
```

`setup.ps1` creates or reuses the Conda environment, installs the Python dependencies, detects CUDA and Visual Studio C++, initializes MSVC x64, builds both CUDA extensions, generates the synthetic smoke input and runs the environment doctor and tests.

A separate Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt is not required.

### Linux

The repository also includes a Bash installer:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

The Linux script checks Conda, CUDA, `g++`, FFmpeg and FFprobe, then builds the CUDA extensions and runs the same validation flow. CUDA and compiler availability still depend on the host Linux installation.

### Validate an existing environment

```bash
python scripts/doctor.py --tests
```

The doctor reports Python, PyTorch, CUDA, GPU, NVCC, compiler availability, FFmpeg, both CUDA extensions, the smoke input and the test suite.

Manual installation and troubleshooting details are available in [docs/INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md) and [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).


## Quick start

The fastest way to validate the complete repository does not require any external video. The project can generate a two-second synthetic audiovisual input locally:

```bash
python scripts/generate_smoke_media.py --force
python scripts/doctor.py --tests
python scripts/pipeline/run_pipeline_video_audio.py --config configs/examples/smoke_20frames/pipeline.json
```

The smoke experiment uses 20 frames, one video epoch, one audio epoch, adaptive pruning at 5% and UINT16 SAFE quantization. It is intended to verify the complete infrastructure, not model quality.

The final audiovisual reconstruction is written under:

```text
outputs/AV_PIPELINE/smoke_20frames/final/
```

Each pipeline run also stores:

```text
environment.json
environment.txt
resumen_pipeline.json
resumen_pipeline.txt
runtime_configs/pipeline_master.json
runtime_configs/video_runtime.json
runtime_configs/audio_runtime.json
```

The environment metadata records the Git commit, dirty state, Python, PyTorch, CUDA, GPU, NVCC, FFmpeg and the SHA256 of the master pipeline configuration.

For a real experiment, start from `configs/templates/` or copy `configs/examples/smoke_20frames/` and replace the source, duration, resolution and model settings. See [docs/CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md).


## Usage

### Training

```bash
python scripts/train.py --config <config.json> [--nombre-experimento NAME]
```

`--nombre-experimento` overrides the name in the config, which is useful when
launching the same configuration several times. By default a run refuses to
start if its output folder already exists. `sobreescribir_salida: true` allows
the folder to be reused; add `limpiar_salida: true` to delete the previous run
before writing the new one. The audiovisual pipeline enables both options for
its generated video and audio runtime configurations.

<details>
<summary><b>Configuration reference</b> — click to expand</summary>

Every experiment is one JSON file. These are the keys that matter; the full
reference is in [Training](wiki/Training.md).

**Clip and run**

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `nombre_experimento` | output folder name; falls back to a timestamp |
| `clip` | folder under `data/clips/` |
| `max_frames` | truncate the clip |
| `device` | `cuda`, `cpu` or `mps`; training requires CUDA |
| `seed` | seeds torch and the model's own generator |
| `sobreescribir_salida` | allow an existing output folder |
| `limpiar_salida` | delete the previous experiment output before starting |

**Model**

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `n_gaussianas_inicial` | $N$ |
| `base_temporal` | `chebyshev` (main) or `monomial` (ablation) |
| `grados` | polynomial degree per attribute |
| `escala_inicial_px` | initial scale; its log becomes `scale`'s $a_0$ |
| `inicializar_color_desde_frame0` | sample initial colours from frame 0 |
| `checkpoint_inicial` | resume from a checkpoint |

**Optimisation** — Adam with twelve parameter groups, six attributes × {`a0`,
`a_high`}, since base values and temporal coefficients need different step
sizes:

```json
"lrs": {
  "mu_a0": 0.001,     "mu_high": 0.0075,
  "opacity_a0": 0.05, "opacity_high": 0.04,
  "color_a0": 0.01,   "color_high": 0.008,
  "scale_a0": 0.005,  "scale_high": 0.004,
  "theta_a0": 0.005,  "theta_high": 0.0025,
  "depth_a0": 0.001,  "depth_high": 0.0001
}
```

Plus `n_epochs`, `sub_batch_frames`, `frames_por_epoch`, `beta_smoothness`,
`pesos_smoothness` and the `scheduler_lento_*` family.

**Loss** — `tipo_loss` selects among `baseline`, `l1_mse`, `motion`, `hard`,
`edge`, `temporal`, `motion_temporal` and `combo`; tuned with `lambda_dssim`,
`lambda_motion`, `lambda_mse`, `lambda_edge`, `lambda_temporal`,
`motion_umbral`, `motion_blur`, `motion_clip`, `exponente_pixel` and
`exponente_frame`. See [Loss Functions](wiki/Loss-Functions.md).

**Rasteriser** — `usar_cuda_tiled` (must be true), `cuda_tile_size` (16),
`cuda_k_sigma` (3.5).

**Memory** — for large trainings:

```json
"frames_en_cpu": true,
"frames_en_gpu_uint8": false,
"evitar_render_completo_en_train": true,
"usar_metricas_streaming": true
```

This is what makes 720p with 100k Gaussians feasible on 8 GB of VRAM.

### Reconstruction and temporal interpolation

Render from a checkpoint one frame at a time, so nothing is stacked in GPU
memory:

```bash
python scripts/reconstruction/regenerar_clip_desde_checkpoint_streaming.py \
    --checkpoint outputs/mi_experimento/checkpoints/checkpoint_final.pt \
    --salida outputs/mi_experimento/frames_renderizados \
    --device cuda \
    [--inicio 0 --fin 300] [--comparaciones --factor_diff 5.0] \
    [--crear_video --fps 30]
```

Temporal interpolation evaluates the **same learned coefficients** at instants
between the original frames. No second network, no optical flow, no training:

```bash
python scripts/reconstruction/regenerar_fps_interpolado.py \
    --checkpoint outputs/mi_experimento/checkpoints/checkpoint_final.pt \
    --salida outputs/mi_experimento/frames_60fps \
    --fps_origen 30 --fps_salida 60 --device cuda
```

### Pruning and quantization

Adaptive pruning tries increasing percentages and keeps the largest reduction
that still meets a PSNR bar against the baseline reconstruction:

```bash
python scripts/compression/run_binary_pruning_adaptativo.py \
    --exp outputs/mi_experimento \
    --checkpoint outputs/mi_experimento/checkpoints/checkpoint_final.pt \
    --baseline_frames outputs/mi_experimento/frames_renderizados \
    --fps 30 --device cuda \
    --inicio_pct 10 --paso_pct 5 --min_pct 10 --max_pct 50 \
    --psnr_min 65 --crear_video_ganador
```

Then quantize the coefficients to 16-bit integers, per tensor:

```bash
python scripts/compression/pack_checkpoint_uint16.py \
    --in_ckpt modelo_pruneado.pt --out_pkg modelo_uint16_safe.pkg.pt \
    --other_float fp32 \
    --quant_tensors mu_high color_high opacity_high scale_high \
    --omit_zero_depth_high

python scripts/compression/unpack_checkpoint_uint16.py \
    --in_pkg modelo_uint16_safe.pkg.pt \
    --out_ckpt modelo_uint16_safe_render.pt --out_float fp32
```

See [Pruning and Quantization](wiki/Pruning-and-Quantization.md) for the ranking
that decides which Gaussians go, and how transient ones are protected.

### Audio

Gabor atoms — Gaussians modulated by a sinusoid — fitted directly on the raw
waveform, with no STFT and no temporal polynomials:

```bash
python scripts/audio/train_gabor.py        --config configs/audio/gabor/gabor_rock_2s_smoke.json
python scripts/audio/train_gabor_stereo.py --config configs/audio/gabor/gabor_rock_30s_stereo_MS_N48k16k.json
python scripts/audio/visualizar.py         --exp outputs/gabor/<experimento>
```

See [Gabor Audio](wiki/Gabor-Audio.md).

### Audiovisual pipeline

One MP4 segment in, one fully reconstructed audiovisual clip out — extraction,
both trainings, pruning, quantization, reconstruction and mux:

```bash
python scripts/pipeline/run_pipeline_video_audio.py \
    --config configs/examples/smoke_20frames/pipeline.json
```

See [Audiovisual Pipeline](wiki/Audiovisual-Pipeline.md).

### Visualisation

```bash
python scripts/visualization/viz_gaussian_stats.py --checkpoint <ckpt> --salida <dir>
```

`scripts/visualization/README.md` lists all eight figure scripts: trajectories,
velocity ellipses, per-attribute curves over time, training filmstrips and
subset renders.

## Repository structure

cuda/                CUDA extensions, compiled per environment

```

`configs/`, `jobs/` and `results/` use the same `video/` and `audio/` split, and
a run keeps the same name across the three: its configuration, the job that
launched it, and the metrics it produced.

`scripts/` is organised by what each tool does — `data`, `reconstruction`,
`compression`, `metrics`, `visualization`, `pipeline`, `audio` — with `train.py`
at the top as the single entry point for training. Each folder has its own
README.

> **A note on language.** Code, comments, configuration keys and file names are
> in Spanish, the language of the thesis this work comes from; the documentation
> is in English. The mapping is direct: `perdidas` is losses, `grados` is
> polynomial degrees, `escala` is scale, `mu` is position.

## Reproducing the paper experiments

1. Rebuild the clip from your own copy of the source material, using the start
   point and duration recorded in the configuration.
2. Install the environment. `requirements-tesis-khipu.txt` freezes the exact
   package versions used on the cluster.
3. Build the CUDA extension in that environment.
4. Run `scripts/train.py` with the configuration from `configs/`.
5. Compare against the `metricas.json` committed under `results/video/<run>/` or
   `results/audio/<run>/`.

`configs/README.md` maps every configuration folder to the experiment it
produces and says which ones have their records committed here.
`results/README.md` lists what is covered and what lives only on the Drive.
`jobs/README.md` documents the Slurm scripts, with the partition, memory and
time limit of each run.

Full bit-exact determinism is not guaranteed: CUDA reductions and the
rasteriser's atomic accumulation are not deterministic across runs, and
`--use_fast_math` is enabled in the build. Expect runs to agree closely, not
exactly. See [Reproducibility](wiki/Reproducibility.md).

## Tests

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

The current suite contains 13 CPU tests. It covers the Chebyshev and monomial bases, model evaluation and metadata, checkpoint loading, pruning basis handling, analytic Gabor gradients, PSNR aggregation including identical-frame `inf` cases, and repository data-path resolution.

The test suite itself does not require a trained model or GPU. Full CUDA runtime validation is performed by `scripts/doctor.py` and the synthetic audiovisual smoke pipeline.

```bash
python scripts/doctor.py --tests
```


## Data and heavy results

The source videos and audio used for the thesis experiments are commercial
recordings and are **not** redistributed here. Each configuration records the
source file, start point and duration. For repository validation, however,
`scripts/generate_smoke_media.py` generates a synthetic audiovisual MP4 locally,
so the smoke test does not depend on private or copyrighted input media.

Rendered videos, reconstructed audio, checkpoints and the full per-experiment
outputs are published separately:

**[Drive: videos, audio and checkpoints](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1N1kAQ0xZ2nKvp4y3VfURjVassB7x6bnB?usp=drive_link)**

The lightweight per-experiment records — metrics, per-frame CSVs and the exact
configuration used — are committed under `results/video/` and `results/audio/`,
so those numbers can be checked without retraining anything.
